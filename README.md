# work-day-scheduler
Project Description:
   This project is a simple work day planner with a few timeblocks to represent the different times of the day. The biggest challenge I faced while making this assignment was getting any user input to save locally. Some features I'd like to implement in the future are adding a checklist feature to check off things the user has completed, as well as making a "clear" button which would function to clear the whole days planner.
